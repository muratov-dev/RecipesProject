### About App

**Recipes** is one of my top 10 favorite projects to show off my skills and build a good portfolio. This app helps the
user browse a list of recipes, save them to favorites, and view instructions on how to cook them.

In this project, I used MVVM and Clean Architecture, which helped me separate the logic and make it easier to extend the
functionality. <br>I also use the Room library as a database, Flow for reactive data processing, and Picasso for loading
images.
